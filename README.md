## 🧭 Project Overview:

Virtual Bloom is a digital marketing agency built around human connection. They came to me with a WIX site that didn't reflect their vision — unclear messaging, poor flow, and outdated design.

My goal was to create a sleek, modern website that feels elegant, intuitive, and human — helping visitors quickly understand what Virtual Bloom does and how to get in touch.

## 💡 Key Objectives:

1. Simplify navigation and content structure.
2. Reflect the "professional yet personal" brand ethos.
3. Create a modern, elegant interface.
4. Make it effortless for visitors to get in touch.

## 🧠 Design Process:

I started by mapping out the user journey and identifying friction points. From there, I built wireframes to define hierarchy and flow, followed by a mood-board to explore tone and visual style.

Through iterative UI design, I refined the layout, spacing, typography rhythm, and calls to action — ensuring each page guided users naturally toward enquiry or conversion.

## 🚀 The Result:

A clean, intuitive website that feels professional yet personal — just like Virtual Bloom's brand. Balancing elegance, usability, and authenticity.
